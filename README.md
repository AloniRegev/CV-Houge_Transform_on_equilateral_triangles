# CV-Houge_Transform_on_equilateral_triangles
The goal is to automatically detect equilateral triangles in natural images using a variant of the Hough Transform. Each detected triangle should be drawn (automatically by your code) using thin lines of a visible color. In each image you will attempt to detect all equilateral triangles of a fixed edge length, at all possible locations and orientations.
